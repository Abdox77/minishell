=====>
	a signal is defined by a unique (small) integer that starts from 1 , and they're defined in the header file <signal.h> , wiht a symbolic name SIGxxx
	since those numberes depend on the implementation , we often use the name given to a certain signal to insure compatibility 

=====>
	Signals falls into two categories : 
					
		-> traditional signals , used by the kernel to notify a ceratin process and they generaly go from 1 to 31
		-> realtime signals ....
=====> 
	after sending a signal an action shoulb taken , when a signal is inbetween sending and taking action we say its a pending signal.

	if we want to block a signal we can simply add it to the mask , if a blocked signal got sent it will remain forever pending.
